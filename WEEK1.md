# Week 1

During the first week, I chose the problem(s) I'd like to solve within this course, and introduced myself to the solutions that I'm going to be using.

Originally, I had intended to do a comparison between 10 or more different sorting algorithms. But I already have a little bit of experience with those, and none with compression algorithms. So I switched problems.

I'm now dedicated to completing an app that tests Huffman coding and LZW algorithms on various different files.

The IDE I'm going to be using is **IntelliJ IDEA Community**, testing will be done with **jUnit 4** (skipping version 5 for now) and code coverage is by **JaCoCo**. Some online tools will be used to assess the quality of my code.
