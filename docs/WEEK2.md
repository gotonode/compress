# Week 2

> At the beginning of the week, I noticed that one of the example projects has the same name as my project. Great minds think alike, I suppose. But I'll resist the urge to see anyone else's code and do everything on my own, relying only on pseudocode found on Wikipedia, Brilliant.org, Princeton University and Rosetta Code (to name a few).

##### What I did this week

I've made the skeleton for the user interface. It's currently not yet working, but the gist of it can already be understood.

##### Progress

Work has been started on Huffman. One can now turn a string into a Huffman-coded binary sequence and back again. This can be done via the test file (not from main code).

##### What I learned this week

Having gone through the code for Huffman in various forms (pseudo, Java, JavaScript, C#), I learned that there are many implementations.

Not all implementations produce the same binary sequences for the same data. It also depends on how the trees are built, if the left node is 0 and the the right node is 1 or the other way around.

When decoding a Huffman-coded binary sequence, it's best done with the same app that did the original coding in the first place.

##### What is unclear

How to read binary data and how to write binary data. I think that'll be at least a minor challenge for the next week.

##### What I'll do next

I'll see how to read binary data and how to write binary data so that I can get Huffman to work.

##### Hours used

TBD.
