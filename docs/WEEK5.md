# Week 5

#### What I did this week

I worked on my own implementation of the minimum priority queue, the `MinQueue` data structure.

#### Progress

#### What I learned this week

Too much time went into building the minimum priority queue because I just implemented many features that turned out not to be needed at all. Huffman doesn't remove items from the priority queue, without polling, so a `remove`-function wasn't necessary (just as an example).

#### What is unclear

#### What I'll do next
