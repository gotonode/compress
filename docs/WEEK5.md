# Week 5

#### What I did this week

I worked on my own implementation of the minimum priority queue, the `MinQueue` data structure.

#### Progress

Huffman and LZW are done and tested. I've also implemented all of the required data structures myself (minimum priority queue and ternary search tree).

#### What I learned this week

Too much time went into building the minimum priority queue because I just implemented many features that turned out not to be needed at all. Huffman doesn't remove items from the priority queue, without polling, so a `remove`-function wasn't necessary (for an example).

#### What is unclear

How to make LZW compression faster. I'll work on that for the final week, but if I'm unable to make it any faster, I'm still happy about the way it came out.

I'll return to this project at a later time during my studies, if there are still issues, and see if I can't fix them then.

#### What I'll do next

For the final week, I'll do the second peer review and do it well.

Finishing touches here and there as well as documentation are also on the agenda. I'll also write a few more tests to fill any gaps that might've been left.

I'll also go through the requirements to see if I've missed anything. 

#### Hours used

9 hours so far.
