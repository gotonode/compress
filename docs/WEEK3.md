# Week 3

##### What I did this week

##### Progress

##### What I learned this week

At first, I had a single class for reading in and writing binary data. This quickly became cumbersome as I had to juggle with variables and name them like "readBuffer" and "writeBuffer". I then just decided to split the two, since Java does it also (with classes such as `BinaryInputStream` and `BinaryOutputStream`).

About a few hours' worth of headache was caused because I forgot to change the input and output file designations. I was wondering why it couldn't read any data, but that was because I was reading from an empty file.

So what I learned is to never assume and to check first. Perhaps next time I won't need to use 3 hours on something trivial such as this, but start debugging from the very core.
