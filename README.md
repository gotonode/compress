# Compress
*Compare Huffman coding and LZW*

> This is a student project and should not be of any interest to anyone not attending this course (related to Data Structures and Algorithms).

In this project, you can compress files using either **Huffman coding** or **LZW**. Decompression, as well as comparisons between the two algorithms, are also possible.
