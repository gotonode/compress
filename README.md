# Compress
*Compare Huffman coding and LZW*

> This is a student project and should not be of any interest to anyone not attending this course (related to Data Structures and Algorithms).

In this project, you can compress files using either **Huffman coding** or **LZW**. Decompression, as well as comparisons between the two algorithms, are also possible.

## The problem

To reduce the size of a file, and to be able to return the original file from the size-reduced file. This is also known as "lossless compression" (compared to "lossy comparison", which results in irrevocable data loss such as with JPEG files).

## Algorithms

Two different algorithms are compared in this project.
