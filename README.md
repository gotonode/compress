# Compress
*Compare Huffman coding and LZW*

This is a student project and should not be of any interest to anyone not attending this course (related to Data Structures and Algorithms).

In this project, you can compress files using either the **Huffman coding** or the **LZW coding**. Decompression, as well as comparisons between the two algorithms, are possible.
